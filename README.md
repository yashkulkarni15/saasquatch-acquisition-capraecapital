#SaaSQuatch AI - Acquisition Intelligence Platform
What I Built
When I first looked at SaaSQuatch Leads, I saw a solid lead generation tool. But then I asked myself: "What's the real problem in M&A?"
It's not finding companies - it's finding companies that are actually ready to sell. So I spent 5 hours building an AI-powered acquisition readiness scorer that turns basic leads into actionable acquisition opportunities.
Quick Start
Python Backend:
bashpython acquisition-scorer-python.py
Web Interface:
Just open saasquatch-acquisition-scorer.html in your browser - no setup required.
My Approach
I focused on solving the biggest pain point in acquisitions: wasting time on companies that aren't ready to sell. Here's what I built:
The Python Engine

Smart Scoring: I created a weighted scoring system based on what actually matters in M&A - owner readiness (30%), financial health (25%), valuation (20%), business quality (15%), and transition ease (10%)
ML Predictions: Added machine learning to predict success probability and suggest deal structures
Market Timing: Built an analyzer that tells you when to move fast vs. when to wait

The Web Interface

Visual Scoring: Each company gets a dynamic score visualization with confidence indicators
AI Insights: Real-time recommendations on timing and approach
Deal Calculator: Interactive tool to model different deal structures and see projected returns
Smart Filters: Pre-built filters for common searches like "Ready Now" or "High Value"

Why This Approach?
I chose to focus on acquisition readiness because:

It's a real problem that costs PE firms millions in wasted time
It aligns perfectly with Caprae's AI-first approach
It's actionable - not just data for data's sake

Technical Choices

Python + HTML: Kept it simple and portable. No complex frameworks or dependencies
Modular Design: Each component (scoring, ML, enrichment) is separate and extensible
Real Data Focus: Built the structure to easily plug in real data sources later

What I Learned
Building this challenged me to think like both an engineer and an investor. The hardest part wasn't the code - it was figuring out what signals actually matter for acquisition success and how to weight them properly.
Next Steps
If I had more time, I'd add:

Live data integration with business databases
Natural language processing for news analysis
Direct CRM integration
Historical deal analysis to refine the ML models
